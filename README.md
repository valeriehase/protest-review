# Protest-Review

This repository contains code for the protest-review within the DFG Network on Protest & CSS Methods.  
Simply run *main.R* to execute all subscripts.  
All paths are project-relative; no working directory needs to be set manually.

## Scripts

**01.load.WoS.data**  
Code to load raw abstract data retrieved via search strings from *Web of Science* (2009–2023) and perform basic data cleaning.

**02.abstract.screening**  
Code to identify CSS and non-CSS research using search strings, intercoder tests, and abstract-level coding.

**03.reliability.testing**  
03a generates coding masks for intercoder reliability testing of full-paper coding.  
03b reads the coded masks and computes intercoder reliability metrics.

**04.final.coding.masks**  
Code to generate the final coding masks for full-paper coding in the main sample.

**05.data.cleaning**  
Code to clean the coded full-paper dataset and document the cleaning process (log).

**06.analysis**  
Code to analyze the cleaned data and produce APA-style summary tables and figures.

## Input data required

Place all required input files in `data/in/` before running `main.R`.

| File | Description |
|------|------------|
| `wos_abstracts_2009_2023.xlsx` | Web of Science abstract export |
| `full_paper_sample.xlsx` | Full-paper sample |
| `full_paper_sample_coded.xlsx` | Coded full-paper sample (pre-deduplication) |
| `dedup_keep_ids.xlsx` | Manually curated list of IDs to retain during deduplication |

## Output data generated

The pipeline never overwrites manually created input files.
All files generated by the pipeline are written to `data/out/`:

- `data/out/intermediate/` – intermediate processing steps (e.g., deduplication tables)
- `data/out/final/` – cleaned analysis dataset and final tables/figures
- `logs/` – data-cleaning and pipeline logs
